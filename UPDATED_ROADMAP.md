# 🧠 LeaderboardBot Development Roadmap

This file provides a step-by-step implementation plan for **LeaderboardBot**, designed to be easily followed and executed by developers or GitHub Copilot.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

- ✅ Create Flask app (`app.py`)
- ✅ Create `schema.sql` with `teams` table for win/loss tracking
- ✅ Add Dockerfile for local deployment
- ✅ Add `render.yaml` for Render deployment

## ✅ Phase 2: UI + Style

- ✅ Add basic leaderboard template in `templates/leaderboard.html`
- ✅ Add CSS styling in `static/css/style.css`
- ✅ Style to match bodegacatsgc.gg branding

## ✅ Phase 3: Deployment and Hosting

- ✅ Write README setup instructions for Docker and Render
- ✅ Test Render hosting and verify at `dashboard.bodegacatsgc.gg`

## ✅ Phase 1: Project Initialization

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/wersplat/LeaderboardBot.git
cd LeaderboardBot
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Phase 2: Core Feature Development

1. **Implement Leaderboard Logic**:
   - Navigate to `src/bot/`.
   - Create a `leaderboard.py` file.
   - Define a `Leaderboard` class with methods to:
     - Add users and their scores.
     - Retrieve top users.
     - Reset the leaderboard.

2. **Integrate Leaderboard with Bot**:
   - Update `main.py` to include commands for:
     - Adding scores.
     - Viewing the leaderboard.

---

## 🎨 Phase 3: Dashboard Integration

1. **Set Up Static Files**:
   - Navigate to `src/dashboard/static/css/`.
   - Add a `styles.css` file for custom styling.

2. **Create Templates**:
   - Navigate to `src/dashboard/templates/`.
   - Add an `index.html` file to display the leaderboard.

3. **Connect Dashboard to Backend**:
   - Update the dashboard code to fetch leaderboard data from the bot.

---

## 🌐 Phase 4: Deployment

1. **Containerize the Application**:
   - Review the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`.
   - Build and run the Docker containers.

2. **Deploy to Cloud**:
   - Choose a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, or Heroku).
   - Deploy the bot and dashboard.

3. **Monitor and Maintain**:
   - Set up monitoring tools to track performance and errors.

---

## 🧪 Phase 5: Testing and Debugging

1. **Write Unit Tests**:
   - Navigate to `src/bot/`.
   - Create a `test_leaderboard.py` file.
   - Write tests for all methods in the `Leaderboard` class.

2. **Run Tests**:
   - Use `pytest` to execute all tests.

3. **Debug Issues**:
   - Use logs and breakpoints to identify and fix issues.
